## wtf is this

This is where I put my Sonic Generations mods, so they can be autoupdated using Hedgemod Manager. You can download the official releases [here](https://github.com/luk234/luk234-gensmods/releases).

## WTFPL

All my mods are released under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/). This means that anything I have made (Model rigging, texture edits, CSB files, hexed files, etc.) or ripped (Spring Cream model parts, Sonic Heroes SFX) is of free use. However, other assets (such as the original models) weren't ripped by me, and the authors must be credited if used. If you are unsure about which assets fully belong to me, please ask me directly, either here or my [Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/luk234/).
